Work-Day-Scheduler application

Upon loading, this application displays the current date in the header.
The timeblocks are arranged using military time for use with moment.js.

The colors of the timeblocks reflect past, present, and future events with differing colors as a responsive design function that responds to the timeblock's relationship with the current time.

Customers are able to enter events and save them to local storage, which still reappear after the page is reloaded, providing a running record of the days events.
